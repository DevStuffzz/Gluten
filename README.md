# Gluten
Gluten Engine is a Cross-Platform 2D/3D game engine that is light-weight, free, and all you have to do is
mention that your project is made using it.

# Disclaimer
The goal is to have a cross-platform engine, but right now is only being tested on Windows

# Long term
Gluten Engine is not meant to be the next Unity. The goal for Gluten is to create something in 
which others can use to learn the basics of Game Development and make a switch to a bigger game engine.
There will not be any high-fedelity ray-traced graphics, but will at least have a nice look and feel
to games made using Gluten.
